These codes are used to calculate the shellâ€”core structure. 
To improve computational efficiency, the rectangular region is divided into four regions, with particle size ratios of 4:2:1:2 or 2:1:1:1 for regions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Currently, only the temperature field has been calculated, and the physical field is still under consideration
